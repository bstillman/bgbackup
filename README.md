# bgbackup

bgbackup works with MariaDB, Percona, MySQL, Galera, etc. 

Backups ran on "fullbackday" will be full backups. Backups ran on other days will be incremental. 

The backups are done with xtrabackup/innobackupex. Backups are compressed (qpress) and encrypted (xbcrypt). 

Details about each backup are emailed to all email addresses listed in MAILLIST and also logged in the database (PERCONA_SCHEMA.xtrabackup_history) for easier monitoring in MONyog, Nagios, Cacti, etc.

Encrypted incremental backups are enabled by decrypting the xtrabackup_checkpoints file. 

Options for inclusion of Galera and slave info.

If Galera option is yes, the script will enable wsrep_desync on the node being backed up. When the backup is finished, it will check for wsrep_local_recv_queue to return to zero before disabling wsrep_desync. 

Option to disable MONyog alerts before, and enable after. 

Use the following to create the encryption key file: 
```
echo -n `openssl rand -base64 24` > /etc/my.cnf.d/backupscript.key
```

Grant these permissions to the backup user  <br />
```
GRANT RELOAD, LOCK TABLES, REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'backup_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'backup_password';
GRANT CREATE, INSERT, SELECT ON PERCONA_SCHEMA.* TO 'backup_user'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES; 
```

Add this info to bottom of /etc/my.cnf (MySQL) or new /etc/my.cnf.d/xtrabackup.cnf (MariaDB): <br />
```
[xtrabackup]
port = 3306
socket = /path/to/socket
datadir = /path/to/datadir
innodb_data_home_dir = /path/to/innodb_data_home_dir
```

Lock down permissions on config file(s)  <br />
```
chown mysql /etc/my.cnf
chmod 600 /etc/my.cnf

chown mysql /etc/my.cnf.d/xtrabackup.cnf
chmod 600 /etc/my.cnf.d/xtrabackup.cnf

chown mysql /etc/my.cnf.d/backupscript.key
chmod 600 /etc/my.cnf.d/backupscript.key
```

Todo: 
- Clean up the clean up.
- Continue testing. 
- Add logic to allow subsequent runs on fullbackday to be incremental.
